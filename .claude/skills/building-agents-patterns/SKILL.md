# Building Agents - Patterns & Best Practices

Design patterns, examples, and best practices for building robust goal-driven agents.

**Prerequisites:** Complete agent structure using `building-agents-construction`.

## Practical Example: Hybrid Workflow

How to build a node using both direct file writes and optional MCP validation:

```python
# 1. WRITE TO FILE FIRST (Primary - makes it visible)
node_code = '''
search_node = NodeSpec(
    id="search-web",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys=["query"],
    output_keys=["search_results"],
    system_prompt="Search the web for: {query}. Use web_search, then call set_output to store results.",
    tools=["web_search"],
)
'''

Edit(
    file_path="exports/research_agent/nodes/__init__.py",
    old_string="# Nodes will be added here",
    new_string=node_code
)

# 2. OPTIONALLY VALIDATE WITH MCP (Secondary - bookkeeping)
validation = mcp__agent-builder__test_node(
    node_id="search-web",
    test_input='{"query": "python tutorials"}',
    mock_llm_response='{"search_results": [...mock results...]}'
)
```

**User experience:**

- Immediately sees node in their editor (from step 1)
- Gets validation feedback (from step 2)
- Can edit the file directly if needed

## Multi-Turn Interaction Patterns

For agents needing multi-turn conversations with users, use `client_facing=True` on event_loop nodes.

### Client-Facing Nodes

A client-facing node streams LLM output to the user and blocks for user input between conversational turns. This replaces the old pause/resume pattern.

```python
# Client-facing node blocks for user input
intake_node = NodeSpec(
    id="intake",
    name="Intake",
    description="Gather requirements from the user",
    node_type="event_loop",
    client_facing=True,
    input_keys=[],
    output_keys=["repo_url", "project_url"],
    system_prompt="You are the intake agent. Ask the user for their repo URL and project URL. When you have both, call set_output for each.",
)

# Internal node runs without user interaction
scanner_node = NodeSpec(
    id="scanner",
    name="Scanner",
    description="Scan the repository",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys=["repo_url"],
    output_keys=["scan_results"],
    system_prompt="Scan the repository at {repo_url}...",
    tools=["scan_github_repo"],
)
```

**How it works:**
- Client-facing nodes stream LLM text to the user and block for input after each response
- User input is injected via `node.inject_event(text)`
- When the LLM calls `set_output` to produce structured outputs, the judge evaluates and ACCEPTs
- Internal nodes (non-client-facing) run their entire loop without blocking

### When to Use client_facing

| Scenario | client_facing | Why |
|----------|:---:|-----|
| Gathering user requirements | Yes | Need user input |
| Human review/approval checkpoint | Yes | Need human decision |
| Data processing (scanning, scoring) | No | Runs autonomously |
| Report generation | No | No user input needed |
| Final confirmation before action | Yes | Need explicit approval |

> **Legacy Note:** The `pause_nodes` / `entry_points` pattern still works for backward compatibility but `client_facing=True` is preferred for new agents.

## Edge-Based Routing and Feedback Loops

### Conditional Edge Routing

Multiple conditional edges from the same source replace the old `router` node type. Each edge checks a condition on the node's output.

```python
# Node with mutually exclusive outputs
review_node = NodeSpec(
    id="review",
    name="Review",
    node_type="event_loop",
    client_facing=True,
    output_keys=["approved_contacts", "redo_extraction"],
    nullable_output_keys=["approved_contacts", "redo_extraction"],
    max_node_visits=3,
    system_prompt="Present the contact list to the operator. If they approve, call set_output('approved_contacts', ...). If they want changes, call set_output('redo_extraction', 'true').",
)

# Forward edge (positive priority, evaluated first)
EdgeSpec(
    id="review-to-campaign",
    source="review",
    target="campaign-builder",
    condition=EdgeCondition.CONDITIONAL,
    condition_expr="output.get('approved_contacts') is not None",
    priority=1,
)

# Feedback edge (negative priority, evaluated after forward edges)
EdgeSpec(
    id="review-feedback",
    source="review",
    target="extractor",
    condition=EdgeCondition.CONDITIONAL,
    condition_expr="output.get('redo_extraction') is not None",
    priority=-1,
)
```

**Key concepts:**
- `nullable_output_keys`: Lists output keys that may remain unset. The node sets exactly one of the mutually exclusive keys per execution.
- `max_node_visits`: Must be >1 on the feedback target (extractor) so it can re-execute. Default is 1.
- `priority`: Positive = forward edge (evaluated first). Negative = feedback edge. The executor tries forward edges first; if none match, falls back to feedback edges.

### Routing Decision Table

| Pattern | Old Approach | New Approach |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Conditional branching | `router` node | Conditional edges with `condition_expr` |
| Binary approve/reject | `pause_nodes` + resume | `client_facing=True` + `nullable_output_keys` |
| Loop-back on rejection | Manual entry_points | Feedback edge with `priority=-1` |
| Multi-way routing | Router with routes dict | Multiple conditional edges with priorities |

## Judge Patterns

Judges control when an event_loop node's loop exits. Choose based on validation needs.

### Implicit Judge (Default)

When no judge is configured, the implicit judge ACCEPTs when:
- The LLM finishes its response with no tool calls
- All required output keys have been set via `set_output`

Best for simple nodes where "all outputs set" is sufficient validation.

### SchemaJudge

Validates outputs against a Pydantic model. Use when you need structural validation.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ScannerOutput(BaseModel):
    github_users: list[dict]  # Must be a list of user objects

class SchemaJudge:
    def __init__(self, output_model: type[BaseModel]):
        self._model = output_model

    async def evaluate(self, context: dict) -> JudgeVerdict:
        missing = context.get("missing_keys", [])
        if missing:
            return JudgeVerdict(
                action="RETRY",
                feedback=f"Missing output keys: {missing}. Use set_output to provide them.",
            )
        try:
            self._model.model_validate(context["output_accumulator"])
            return JudgeVerdict(action="ACCEPT")
        except ValidationError as e:
            return JudgeVerdict(action="RETRY", feedback=str(e))
```

### When to Use Which Judge

| Judge | Use When | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Implicit (None) | Output keys are sufficient validation | Simple data extraction |
| SchemaJudge | Need structural validation of outputs | API response parsing |
| Custom | Domain-specific validation logic | Score must be 0.0-1.0 |

## Fan-Out / Fan-In (Parallel Execution)

Multiple ON_SUCCESS edges from the same source trigger parallel execution. All branches run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`.

```python
# Scanner fans out to Profiler and Scorer in parallel
EdgeSpec(id="scanner-to-profiler", source="scanner", target="profiler",
         condition=EdgeCondition.ON_SUCCESS)
EdgeSpec(id="scanner-to-scorer", source="scanner", target="scorer",
         condition=EdgeCondition.ON_SUCCESS)

# Both fan in to Extractor
EdgeSpec(id="profiler-to-extractor", source="profiler", target="extractor",
         condition=EdgeCondition.ON_SUCCESS)
EdgeSpec(id="scorer-to-extractor", source="scorer", target="extractor",
         condition=EdgeCondition.ON_SUCCESS)
```

**Requirements:**
- Parallel event_loop nodes must have **disjoint output_keys** (no key written by both)
- Only one parallel branch may contain a `client_facing` node
- Fan-in node receives outputs from all completed branches in shared memory

## Context Management Patterns

### Tiered Compaction

EventLoopNode automatically manages context window usage with tiered compaction:
1. **Pruning** — Old tool results replaced with compact placeholders (zero-cost, no LLM call)
2. **Normal compaction** — LLM summarizes older messages
3. **Aggressive compaction** — Keeps only recent messages + summary
4. **Emergency** — Hard reset with tool history preservation

### Spillover Pattern

For large tool results, use `save_data()` to write to disk and pass the filename through `set_output`. This keeps the LLM context window small.

```
LLM calls save_data(filename, large_data) → file written to spillover/
LLM calls set_output("results_file", filename) → filename stored in output
Downstream node calls load_data(filename) → reads from spillover/
```

The `load_data()` tool supports `offset` and `limit` parameters for paginated reading of large files.

## Anti-Patterns

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't rely on `export_graph`** — Write files immediately, not at end
- **Don't hide code in session** — Write to files as components are approved
- **Don't wait to write files** — Agent visible from first step
- **Don't batch everything** — Write incrementally, one component at a time

### MCP Tools - Correct Usage

**MCP tools OK for:**
- `test_node` — Validate node configuration with mock inputs
- `validate_graph` — Check graph structure
- `configure_loop` — Set event loop parameters
- `create_session` — Track session state for bookkeeping

**Just don't:** Use MCP as the primary construction method or rely on export_graph

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Failure with Fallback

```python
edges = [
    # Success path
    EdgeSpec(id="api-success", source="api-call", target="process-results",
             condition=EdgeCondition.ON_SUCCESS),
    # Fallback on failure
    EdgeSpec(id="api-to-fallback", source="api-call", target="fallback-cache",
             condition=EdgeCondition.ON_FAILURE, priority=1),
    # Report if fallback also fails
    EdgeSpec(id="fallback-to-error", source="fallback-cache", target="report-error",
             condition=EdgeCondition.ON_FAILURE, priority=1),
]
```

## Handoff to Testing

When agent is complete, transition to testing phase:

### Pre-Testing Checklist

- [ ] Agent structure validates: `python -m agent_name validate`
- [ ] All nodes defined in nodes/__init__.py
- [ ] All edges connect valid nodes with correct priorities
- [ ] Feedback edge targets have `max_node_visits > 1`
- [ ] Client-facing nodes have meaningful system prompts
- [ ] Agent can be imported: `from exports.agent_name import default_agent`
